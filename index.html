            </strong>
            In the period 1994â€“1999 Torvalds developed versions of Linux on early AlphaServer systems made available to him by the engineering department of Digital Equipment Corporation. Compaq software engineers developed special Linux kernel modules.[61] Linux distributions that ran on AlphaServer systems were Red Hat 7.2.[62] and Gentoo Linux.

                        In 1996, the asteroid 9793 Torvalds was named after him. In 2003, the naming of the asteroid moon Linus was motivated in part by the fact that the discoverer was an enthusiastic Linux user. Although the naming proposal referred to the mythological Linus, son of the muse Calliope and the inventor of melody and rhythm, the name was also meant to honor Linus Torvalds, and Linus van Pelt, a character in the Peanuts comic strip.[60]
